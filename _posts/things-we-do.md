Exploration always motivated me, be it meeting people with different cultures, hikes, climbs or even food. I love those days when you wake up with excitement to do something. At one point it used to be more about interacting with people(more anxiety than excitement there), or playing something, or going on a trip(that was probably the most exciting thing!).

A phase of my life was defined mostly by action, especially when I realized I had the resources to go after all that looked cool! But, action almost always was a direct consequence of certainty - about things in general as well as the path that was taken until then.

#### Is action always good?

All that action created an aura of happiness, and social media reflects that immensely, but actions - travels, dives, hikes etc. if undertaken without really, truly empathizing with your body or with the people you meet can end up being a fleeting memory rather than a character enhancing truth.

While not everything has to be a 'character enhancing truth', a generally directed course of action should probably work! 

### Time to reflect

Covid lockdowns, albeit disastrous for many, also let us be with ourselves, reflect on our lives. There was little possibility for travel so, for me, 'looking inwards' was exciting.

Hikes by myself used to be generally more relaxing than the ones that I invariably end up guiding when I go with friends. But during the last camping trip with friends, I was able to consciously calm my nerves, breathe and feel the calm in the wilderness.

Life generally doesn't have to be difficult, we make it - sometimes as individuals, but generally as a society - we choose to divide ourselves based on some traditions that may have expired beyond legibility, stop questioning or even communicating about things.

Even as individuals, we tend to appreciate less and criticize unnecessarily.
Being gentle towards myself and towards others is something that I think I improved on over the pandemic, and still have a long way to go. I'm glad to have friends who accommodate me as well as keep me honest when I veer of my path.
Not that they're perfect, but probably that is how we should be - support each other and do things.

I think it important to remember that we're all building on top of what came before us, none of what we do is **just** an individual achievement.
