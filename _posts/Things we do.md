### Not all actions have obvious consequences

Life has always been about exploration - it was about exploring the world, the cultures in the world a few years back - this was interesting in many ways, but, more recently, it has been primarily about exploring myself, understanding my mind and body.

### All about action

A phase of my life was only defined by action, especially when I realized I had the resources to go after all that looked cool! But, action almost always was a direct consequence of certainty, about things in general as well as the path that was taken until then. 

### Is action always good?

All that action created an aura of happiness, and social media reflects that immensely, but actions - travels, dives, hikes etc. if undertaken without really, truly empathizing with your body or with the people you meet will end up being a fleeting memory rather than a character enhancing truth.

### Time to reflect

Covid lockdowns, albeit being disastrous for many, also let us stay by ourselves, reflect on our lives. This was little possibility for travel so 'looking inwards' was exciting.

Hikes by myself used to be generally more relaxing than the ones that I invariably end up guiding when I go with friends. But the last camping trip, I was able to consciously calm my nerves, breathe and feel the calm in the wilderness. 

Life generally doesn't have to be difficult, we make it - not as individuals, but as a society, we make rules, choose to divide ourselves based on some traditions that may have expired beyond legibility.
